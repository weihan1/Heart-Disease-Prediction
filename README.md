10-year Coronary Heart Disease Prediction is a personal Machine Learning project that I've worked on during the summer and that I'm still working on. I've imported the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/amayomordecai/heart-disease-risk-prediction-machine-learning), and we're trying to predict whether a new patient would develop a 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) based on 15 risk factors. The dataset includes 4000 residents of the city of Framingham and their corresponding risk factors. In my project, I've performed a simple EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to check how much each variable influence the likelihood of developing CHD, and I've fitted a logisic regression model and a neural network.
